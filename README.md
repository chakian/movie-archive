# movie-archive
Simple web app to manage a personal movie archive

This is a web application (an MVC 4 web application to be precise) and I'm currently creating a new web site using Angular.js.

#### Configuration for Facebook and Google authentication relies on applications created in those services. Therefore, to be able to use them you need to follow these steps:

1. Copy "MArchiveAuthAppSettings_sample.config" file to wherever is fine for you to keep this configuration file
2. Find the line "<appSettings file="..\..\MArchiveAuthAppSettings.config"></appSettings>" inside the Web.Config file of Authentication.API project.
3. Either rename the file or change web.config to meet your own need.

Hopefully, one day, I'll start working on an Android application too... We'll see.

I have no idea what else to write in this readme file, so I'll just go back to work.
