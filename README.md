# movie-archive
Simple web app to manage a personal movie archive

This is a web application (an MVC 4 web application to be precise) and I'm currently creating a new web site using Angular.js.

Hopefully, after finishing the development of authentication web service, I'll start working on an Android application too... We'll see.

I have no idea what else to write in this readme file, so I'll just go back to work.
